# Steller

This demo app contains some best practices for iOS app development in Swift:
- MVVM architecture
- Theming
- Localization
- Unit tests
- Custom SwiftUI elements

# Architecture

In this branch the Steller demo app is implemented using a MVVM for SwiftUI.

For such a small demo the MVVM version is sufficient, but for larger projects I recommend the use of Clean architecture. Please take a look at `cleanswiftui` branch for a sample implementation.
